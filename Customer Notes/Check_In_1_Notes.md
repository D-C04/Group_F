*From Customers:*

Customers enjoyed the site map proposals and understood what we were going for. They wanted to ensure we keep the blue colour in the final design. The customers did not have much to note but enjoyed the idea of a video and reiterated the important need for connection. They agreed with the donation and contact button being on every page being an idea they would like to pursue. They had agreed with our empathy maps and that our findings resonated with their needs.
