# Notes  

## Homepage

One box on the links is smaller
Center align and in box - stretch
Add more colour
Feels too corporate
Bring in more fun elements like in the high fidelity prototype

## Donate Page
Black link - change to white
Likes the monthly donate button toggle

## Header/Footer

Add header image to all pages
Consistency across page headers - Text alignment and colour
Add privacy policy 
Different colours of puzzle images - not white

## Events
Likes the news room to have all notices
Have to separate events and upcoming programs - subpages
Change to “Whats happening” or “updates” with a drop down
Dropdown can include two sections - ‘News’ and ‘Events’
‘News’ section can be blogs

## Stock Imagery
Stock images need a disclaimer page - make sure to cite: in footer 
Privacy policy in footer - not in main menu
Don't distract from content with disclaimer ie, don't make the page in the main menu or put the credits directly on the site

## Our services
Likes the tabs

## Contact
Boxes are not same size
Colour boxes - blue 
More fun elements here

## Site Identity
Less white all over
Feels too corporate, wants more fun and toys
Half business and half fun - find a balance 
More pictures - they will provide more
