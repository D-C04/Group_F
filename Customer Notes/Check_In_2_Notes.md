## Notes 

### Likes
* that the obvious signs/buttons were obvious
* the addition of card/puzzles/blocks to represent their goal and methods of teaching children 
* that navigation is simple (discouraged additional pages)  
### Dislikes/Wants : 
* more/better videos and pictures 
* a change in colour on some leters in header (too bright against white background)
* left alignment for better readability (note from brooklyn)
* all fixed buttons/menus to block text (instead of being see through)
